## Weakly Supervised Learning: Introduction and Best Practices

The project has been prepared for the meetup held by <b>Data Science Milano</b>. 

Here you can find the definition of three main types of weakly supervised learning: incomplete, inexact and inaccurate; how different models of ML and DL can be trained in case of weak supervision and view the real application (Brexit Tweets Classification) of weakly supervised learning, how it can improve results and decrease the costs.
